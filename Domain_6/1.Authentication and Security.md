## Authentication and Security

### Explain how to secure your account with 2FA

Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) is a security measure that requires two types of identification before granting access to an account. It adds an extra layer of security to your account by requiring something you know (your password) and something you have (like your phone or a physical token).

Here's a general step-by-step guide on how to secure your account with 2FA:

1. **Enable 2FA in your account settings**: Most online platforms have an option to enable 2FA in the account or security settings. Look for options like "Two-Factor Authentication," "2-Step Verification," or similar.

2. **Choose your authentication method**: Common methods include text messages (SMS), authentication apps (like Google Authenticator or Authy), or physical security keys. Choose the one that suits you best.

3. **Set up your chosen method**: If you choose SMS, you'll need to provide your phone number. If you choose an authentication app, you'll need to scan a QR code with the app. If you choose a security key, you'll need to insert it into your device and tap it when prompted.

4. **Confirm the setup**: After setting up, the service will typically ask you to enter a code generated by your chosen method to confirm that it's working correctly.

5. **Backup your 2FA method**: It's crucial to have a backup in case you lose access to your primary 2FA method. This could be backup codes provided by the service, a backup phone number, or a backup security key.

Remember, the exact steps may vary depending on the specific platform or service you're using. Always refer to the official documentation for the most accurate information.

### Describe the different access permissions

Access permissions, also known as access rights or privileges, determine what actions a user can perform on a system or a specific resource within a system. They are a fundamental part of security management to prevent unauthorized access or modification of resources. Here are some common types of access permissions:

1. **Read**: This permission allows a user to view the contents of a file or directory. It doesn't allow them to make any changes.

2. **Write**: This permission allows a user to modify a file or directory. This includes creating, editing, and deleting files or directories.

3. **Execute**: This permission allows a user to run a file or script. In the context of a directory, it allows a user to access and list the contents of the directory.

4. **Full Control**: This permission combines read, write, and execute permissions. A user with full control can view, modify, and run files or directories.

5. **Modify**: This permission is similar to full control but doesn't allow a user to change the permissions of a file or directory.

6. **List Folder Contents**: This permission, typically used for directories, allows a user to view and list the files and subdirectories within a directory.

These permissions can be assigned to individual users or groups of users. They can also be inherited from parent directories. The exact names and behaviors of these permissions can vary depending on the operating system or platform. Always refer to the official documentation for the most accurate information.

### Explain EMUs (Enterprise Managed Users)

Enterprise Managed Users (EMUs) is a feature available in GitHub Enterprise Cloud that allows enterprise owners to centrally manage the GitHub.com user accounts and their access to the enterprise's resources. This is particularly useful for organizations that need to maintain control over their users' accounts for security, compliance, or regulatory reasons.

Here's how EMUs work:

1. **Centralized Control**: Enterprise owners can create and manage user accounts, and control their access to enterprise resources. This includes the ability to enforce security policies like Two-Factor Authentication (2FA).

2. **Access Management**: Enterprise owners can manage which repositories a user can access, and what permissions they have in those repositories.

3. **Audit Logs**: Actions performed by managed users are recorded in the enterprise's audit log, providing visibility and accountability.

4. **Account Recovery**: If a managed user forgets their password or loses access to their account, the enterprise owner can help them recover it.

In summary, Enterprise Managed Users (EMUs) is a feature in GitHub Enterprise Cloud that provides centralized control over user accounts and their access to enterprise resources. It's particularly useful for organizations that need to maintain control over their users' accounts for security, compliance, or regulatory reasons.
