## Authentication and Security

### Explain how to secure your account with 2FA

Existing GitHub Actions can be found in the GitHub Marketplace. The GitHub Marketplace is a central location for developers to browse, share, and use actions created by the community. You can find actions for a variety of tasks, such as deploying code, running tests, or automating issue responses.

To access the GitHub Marketplace, you can navigate to the main GitHub website and click on "Marketplace" in the top navigation bar. From there, you can select "Actions" in the left sidebar to browse available actions. You can search for specific actions, filter by categories, or sort by popularity or recent updates.

In addition to the GitHub Marketplace, you can also find actions in public repositories on GitHub. If an action is stored in a public repository, you can reference it in your workflows by using the owner/repository@ref format.

In summary, you can find existing GitHub Actions in the GitHub Marketplace and in public repositories on GitHub.

### Explain EMUs (Enterprise Managed Users)

Enterprise Managed Users (EMUs) is a feature available in GitHub Enterprise Cloud that allows enterprise owners to centrally manage the GitHub.com user accounts and their access to the enterprise's resources. This is particularly useful for organizations that need to maintain control over their users' accounts for security, compliance, or regulatory reasons.

Here's how EMUs work:

1. **Centralized Control**: Enterprise owners can create and manage user accounts, and control their access to enterprise resources. This includes the ability to enforce security policies like Two-Factor Authentication (2FA).

2. **Access Management**: Enterprise owners can manage which repositories a user can access, and what permissions they have in those repositories.

3. **Audit Logs**: Actions performed by managed users are recorded in the enterprise's audit log, providing visibility and accountability.

4. **Account Recovery**: If a managed user forgets their password or loses access to their account, the enterprise owner can help them recover it.

In summary, Enterprise Managed Users (EMUs) is a feature in GitHub Enterprise Cloud that provides centralized control over user accounts and their access to enterprise resources. It's particularly useful for organizations that need to maintain control over their users' accounts for security, compliance, or regulatory reasons.
