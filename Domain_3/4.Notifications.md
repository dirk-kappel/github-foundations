## Notifications

### Describe how to manage notification subscriptions

Managing notification subscriptions in GitHub allows you to control what updates you receive about activity in repositories, issues, pull requests, and discussions. Here's how you can manage your notification subscriptions:

1. **Repository Notifications**: To manage notifications for a specific repository, navigate to the repository's main page. Click on the "Watch" button at the top right of the page. Here, you can choose to "Watch" the repository (receive all notifications), "Not watch" (only receive notifications for your participations and @mentions), or "Ignore" (receive no notifications).

2. **Issue and Pull Request Notifications**: When you participate in an issue or pull request (for example, by commenting or opening it), you're automatically subscribed to notifications for updates. You can manually subscribe or unsubscribe by clicking the "Notifications" button on the right side of the issue or pull request page.

3. **Discussion Notifications**: Similar to issues and pull requests, you're automatically subscribed to a discussion when you participate in it. You can also manually subscribe or unsubscribe using the "Notifications" button on the discussion page.

4. **Global Notification Settings**: To manage your overall notification settings, click on your profile picture at the top right of any page, then click "Settings". From the settings page, click on "Notifications" in the left sidebar. Here, you can customize your email preferences, choose how you want to be notified about different types of activity, and manage your watched repositories.

Remember, managing your notifications effectively can help you stay updated on the activity that's most important to you, without getting overwhelmed by unnecessary updates.

### Explain how to subscribe to notification threads

Subscribing to notification threads in GitHub allows you to receive updates about specific conversations, such as issues, pull requests, or discussions. Here's how you can subscribe to a notification thread:

1. **Navigate to the Thread**: First, go to the page for the issue, pull request, or discussion that you want to subscribe to. This could be in the "Issues", "Pull requests", or "Discussions" tab of a repository.

2. **Subscribe to the Thread**: On the right side of the page, you'll see a "Notifications" button. Click on this button and then select "Subscribe" from the dropdown menu.

You are now subscribed to the thread and will receive notifications for any new activity in this thread, such as new comments or status changes.

Remember, you're automatically subscribed to any threads that you create or participate in. You can also unsubscribe from a thread at any time by clicking the "Notifications" button again and selecting "Unsubscribe".

### Describe how to find threads where you are at-mentioned

Finding threads where you are @-mentioned in GitHub allows you to quickly navigate to conversations that require your attention. Here's how you can find these threads:

1. **Notification Inbox**: The easiest way to find threads where you are @-mentioned is through your Notification Inbox. Click on the bell icon at the top right of any GitHub page to open your Notification Inbox. Here, you'll see a list of all notifications, including threads where you've been @-mentioned.

2. **Filter by Mention**: In your Notification Inbox, you can filter notifications to only show threads where you've been @-mentioned. To do this, click on the "Filter" box at the top of the page, then select "Mentions" from the dropdown menu.

3. **Email Notifications**: If you have email notifications enabled in your GitHub settings, you'll also receive an email whenever you're @-mentioned in a thread. The email will contain a link to the thread.

Remember, @-mentions are a way for other users to get your attention in a thread. When you're @-mentioned, it's usually because someone wants your input or needs you to take action on something.

### Identify the notification filtering options

GitHub provides several options to filter your notifications, helping you to focus on the updates that are most important to you. Here are the main notification filtering options:

1. **Repository Name**: You can filter notifications based on the repository they're associated with. Just type the name of the repository in the filter box.

2. **Reason**: You can filter notifications based on why you're receiving them. For example, you can filter to only see notifications where you're directly @-mentioned, or where you've been assigned a task. Other reasons include: your comment, author, state change, subscribed, team mention, and manual.

3. **Type**: You can filter notifications based on their type, such as Issues, Pull Requests, or Discussions.

4. **Unread/Read**: You can choose to only see unread notifications, or you can also include read notifications in your list.

5. **Participating**: You can filter to only see notifications from threads you're participating in.

To apply a filter, you click on the "Filter" box at the top of your notifications page, then select the filter you want to apply from the dropdown menu. You can apply multiple filters at once to further narrow down your list of notifications.

Remember, using filters effectively can help you manage your notifications and stay focused on the most important updates.

### Explain the different notification configuration options

GitHub provides several notification configuration options to help you manage and control the updates you receive. Here are the main notification configuration options:

1. **Automatic Watching**: By default, when you're given push access to a repository, you'll automatically start watching it, which means you'll receive notifications for all conversations. You can disable this in your notification settings if you prefer to manually choose which repositories to watch.

2. **Participating Notifications**: These are notifications for updates in conversations where you've actively participated, for example by commenting on an issue or opening a pull request. You can choose to receive these notifications via the web, email, or both.

3. **Watching Notifications**: These are notifications for updates in repositories that you're watching. You can choose to receive these notifications via the web, email, or both.

4. **Email Preferences**: You can choose whether to receive email notifications for each update individually, or in a daily summary. You can also add a custom email address for receiving notifications.

5. **Notification Threads**: For each notification thread, you can choose to mute the thread, mark it as read, or customize your subscription to the thread.

6. **Blocked Users**: Users you've blocked will not be able to comment on your posts and you won't receive notification from them.

To access your notification settings, click on your profile picture at the top right of any GitHub page, then click "Settings". From the settings page, click on "Notifications" in the left sidebar.

Remember, configuring your notifications effectively can help you stay updated on the activity that's most important to you, without getting overwhelmed by unnecessary updates.
