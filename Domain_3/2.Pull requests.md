## Pull requests

### Describe a pull request

A pull request is a way to document branch changes and communicate that the changes from the developer’s branch are ready to be merged into the base (main) branch. Pull requests enable stakeholders to review and discuss the proposed changes to ensure that the code quality in the base branch is kept as high as possible.

### Explain how to create a new pull request

Creating a new pull request in GitHub involves several steps. Here's a general guide on how to do it:

1. **Create a new branch**: In your local repository, create a new branch for the changes you want to make. You can do this with the command `git checkout -b branch-name`.

2. **Make your changes**: Make the necessary changes to your code or content on this new branch.

3. **Commit your changes**: Once you're done with your changes, stage them with `git add .` (to add all changes) or `git add file-name` (to add specific files), and then commit them with `git commit -m "Your commit message"`.

4. **Push your changes**: Push your changes to the remote repository with `git push origin branch-name`.

5. **Open a pull request on GitHub**: Go to the GitHub page for the repository and click on "Pull requests". Then click on "New pull request". Select your branch from the dropdown menu, and click "Create pull request".

6. **Describe your changes**: Give your pull request a title and describe the changes you've made. This helps others understand what your pull request is about and why the changes should be incorporated.

7. **Create the pull request**: Click on "Create pull request" to submit your pull request.

Once you've created your pull request, others can review your changes, discuss modifications, and eventually merge your changes into the main codebase. Remember to pull the latest changes from the main branch and resolve any conflicts before creating a pull request.

### Describe the `base` and `compare` branches in a pull request

- The compare branch is the developer’s own branch, which contains the specific changes they made.
- The base branch, also referred to as the main branch, is the branch that the changes need to be merged into.

### Explain the relationship of commits on a pull request

In the context of a pull request, commits represent the individual changes that you're proposing to be merged into the target branch. Each commit contains a snapshot of changes made to the codebase, including additions, modifications, or deletions of code.

Here's how commits relate to a pull request:

1. **Creating a Pull Request**: When you create a pull request, you're proposing that the commits on your branch should be incorporated into another branch (usually the main or master branch). The pull request contains all the commits from your branch that are not present in the target branch.

2. **Reviewing Changes**: The changes proposed in each commit can be reviewed individually in a pull request. This allows reviewers to see exactly what changes were made and when. They can comment on the entire pull request or on individual lines of code within a commit.

3. **Updating a Pull Request**: If you need to make additional changes after creating a pull request, you can push more commits to your branch. These new commits will automatically be included in the existing pull request. This is useful for addressing feedback from reviewers.

4. **Merging a Pull Request**: When a pull request is merged, all of its commits are added to the target branch in the same order they appear on your branch. Depending on the project's settings, these commits may be merged as-is (creating a merge commit), squashed into a single commit, or rebased onto the target branch.

In summary, commits are the building blocks of a pull request. They allow for granular changes, making it easier to review and understand what changes are being proposed.

### Describe draft pull requests

Draft pull requests are a feature on GitHub that allows you to open a pull request that is not ready for review yet. It's a way to start a conversation about your changes early on, or when you want to share work in progress with others for feedback.

Here's how draft pull requests work:

1. **Create a draft pull request**: When creating a new pull request, you can click the dropdown arrow next to the "Create pull request" button and select "Create draft pull request". This will mark your pull request as a draft.

2. **Marked as draft**: Draft pull requests are clearly marked so others know they're not ready for review. They cannot be merged until they're marked as ready for review.

3. **Work on your changes**: You can continue pushing commits to the branch associated with the draft pull request. These changes will be reflected in the pull request.

4. **Request feedback**: Even though it's a draft, others can still see your pull request, comment on it, and even add commits to it. This allows you to gather feedback early on.

5. **Mark as ready for review**: Once you're ready for the pull request to be reviewed, you can click on "Ready for review" at the bottom of the pull request. This will remove the draft status, and the pull request can now be reviewed and eventually merged.

Draft pull requests are a great way to collaborate and get feedback on your work before it's finalized. They can help improve code quality and ensure that everyone is aligned on the changes being made.

### Describe the purpose of the pull request tabs (conversation, commits, checks, files changed)

In GitHub, when you open a pull request, you'll notice several tabs: Conversation, Commits, Checks, and Files changed. Each of these tabs serves a specific purpose in the pull request review process:

1. **Conversation**: This tab is where the overall discussion about the pull request takes place. Here, you can see the initial comment made when the pull request was opened, comments from reviewers, system-generated messages about commits or other actions, and any general discussion about the pull request. You can also see the status of the pull request, whether it's open, closed, or merged.

2. **Commits**: This tab lists all the commits that have been made on the branch associated with the pull request. Each commit shows the commit message, the author, and the date and time of the commit. This allows reviewers to see the history of changes and review each commit individually if needed.

3. **Checks**: This tab is where you can see the status of any continuous integration (CI) tests or other checks that have been set up for the repository. For each commit, it will show whether the checks passed, failed, or are still in progress. This helps ensure that the changes in the pull request don't break any existing functionality.

4. **Files changed**: This tab shows the actual changes made to the code in the pull request. It displays a diff of all the changes, with additions shown in green and deletions in red. Reviewers can comment directly on any line of code in this view, which is useful for discussing specific changes.

These tabs help organize the information and discussions related to a pull request, making it easier for both the author and the reviewers to understand and track the changes and discussions.

### Identify how to link activity within a pull request

Linking activity within a pull request in GitHub can help provide context and make collaboration more efficient. Here's how you can do it:

1. **Linking Issues**: If your pull request is related to an issue, you can link it by mentioning the issue number in the pull request description or in a comment. You simply need to type "#" followed by the issue number and GitHub will automatically create a link to the issue. For example, typing "#123" will link to issue number 123 in the same repository.

2. **Linking Commits**: You can also link to specific commits within a pull request. To do this, you need to use the commit's SHA hash. You can find this hash in the commit list on the "Commits" tab of the pull request. Copy the hash, then paste it into a comment or the pull request description. GitHub will automatically create a link to the commit.

3. **Linking to Comments**: If you want to reference a specific comment within the pull request, you can do so by grabbing the link to the comment. Click on the three dots in the upper-right corner of the comment, then select "Copy link". You can then paste this link in a new comment or the pull request description.

4. **Linking Pull Requests**: You can link to other pull requests in a similar way to linking issues. Just type "#" followed by the pull request number.

Remember, linking activity within a pull request can help provide context, make it easier to navigate, and improve collaboration.

### Explain the different pull request statuses

Pull requests in GitHub can have several statuses, each indicating a different stage in the pull request lifecycle. Here are the main statuses you'll encounter:

1. **Open**: When a pull request is first created, its status is "Open". This means it's ready for review and discussion. The pull request remains in this status until it's either closed or merged.

2. **Draft**: A pull request can be marked as a "Draft" when it's not ready for review. Draft pull requests are a way to share work in progress with others. They cannot be merged until they're marked as ready for review.

3. **Closed**: If a pull request is no longer relevant, or if the proposed changes are not going to be merged, the pull request can be "Closed". This means no further activity will occur on it, and it won't be merged. However, the discussion and changes are still visible for future reference.

4. **Merged**: Once the changes in a pull request have been approved and all discussions have been resolved, the pull request can be "Merged". This means the changes have been incorporated into the target branch. Once a pull request is merged, it's also closed.

5. **Changes requested**: During the review process, if a reviewer requests changes, the pull request will have a "Changes requested" status. This means the author needs to make some modifications before the pull request can be merged.

6. **Approved**: If a reviewer approves the changes in a pull request, it will have an "Approved" status. This means it's ready to be merged, assuming all other checks and requirements have been met.

These statuses help manage the pull request process, making it clear at a glance what stage each pull request is at.

### Recognize how to comment on a posted link to a line or lines of code from a file

Commenting on a specific line or lines of code in a pull request is a common practice in code reviews on GitHub. It allows you to provide targeted feedback or ask questions about specific parts of the changes. Here's how you can do it:

1. **Navigate to the Files Changed tab**: In the pull request, go to the "Files changed" tab. This tab shows all the changes made in the pull request.

2. **Find the line of code**: Scroll through the changes to find the specific line or lines of code you want to comment on.

3. **Add a comment**: Click on the line number next to the code. This will open a comment box. Type your comment in the box. You can use Markdown to format your comment, add code snippets, or even include links and images.

4. **Submit your comment**: Click the "Start a review" button if you plan to add more comments (they'll be bundled together), or "Add single comment" if that's the only comment you're making. 

Once you've submitted your comment, others will be able to see it and respond. If you started a review, you'll need to go to the top of the page and click "Review changes" to submit all your comments at once.

Remember, when commenting on code, it's important to be clear and constructive. Explain why you're suggesting a change or asking a question, and always be respectful.

### Describe code review with a codeowners file

A CODEOWNERS file in a GitHub repository is used to define individuals or teams that are responsible for code in a repository. When a pull request modifies code that has a designated owner, those individuals or teams are automatically requested for review.

Here's how code review works with a CODEOWNERS file:

1. **Creating a CODEOWNERS file**: The CODEOWNERS file is usually located in the repository's root directory or in the `.github` directory. The file contains lines that associate parts of the codebase with certain owners. Each line includes a file pattern followed by one or more owners (either GitHub usernames or team names).

2. **Automatic Review Requests**: When a pull request is opened that modifies code matching a file pattern in the CODEOWNERS file, the corresponding owners are automatically requested for review. This ensures that the right people are notified about changes to the code they're responsible for.

3. **Required Reviews**: If a repository is configured to require a review from code owners, then the pull request cannot be merged until a code owner approves it. This helps ensure that changes are reviewed by the people most familiar with the code.

4. **Code Owner Protection**: In addition to automatic review requests, the CODEOWNERS file can also be used to enforce certain protections. For example, you can prevent code owners from unwatching repositories, or require that code owners always be the ones to merge pull requests for their code.

In summary, a CODEOWNERS file helps streamline the code review process by ensuring that the right people review changes to the code they own. It's a powerful tool for maintaining high code quality and fostering ownership within a development team.

### Explain the different options for providing a code review on a pull request (comment, approve, request changes, suggested changes)

1. **Comment**: This option allows you to leave a comment on a specific line of code or on the pull request as a whole. This is useful for asking questions, discussing potential improvements, or simply acknowledging good code. Comments do not inherently carry an approval or request for changes.

2. **Approve**: If you're satisfied with the changes in the pull request, you can choose to approve it. This signals to the team that you believe the changes are ready to be merged into the base branch.

3. **Request Changes**: If you believe the pull request needs additional work before it can be merged, you can choose to request changes. This will require the pull request author to make further changes before the pull request can be merged.

4. **Suggested Changes**: This is a special type of comment where you can propose specific changes to the code. The author of the pull request can then choose to accept your suggestion with a single click, which will automatically commit the change to the pull request branch.

In summary, when reviewing a pull request, you can comment for general discussion, approve if the changes are ready to merge, request changes if further work is needed, or suggest specific changes to the code. Each option allows for different levels of feedback and interaction, helping to ensure that the final code is as good as it can be.
