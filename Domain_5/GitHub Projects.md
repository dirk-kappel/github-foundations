# Manage your work with GitHub Projects

### Describe GitHub Projects

GitHub Projects is a feature that provides a space for planning, organizing, and visualizing your work. It's essentially a project management tool integrated directly into GitHub. It allows you to create Kanban-style boards to manage your issues, pull requests, and notes.

Here's a brief overview of how GitHub Projects works:

1. **Project Boards**: You can create project boards at the level of a repository, a user, or an organization. Each board can have multiple columns (like "To do", "In progress", and "Done") that represent different stages of your workflow.

2. **Cards**: Within these columns, you can create cards that represent tasks. Cards can be issues, pull requests, or notes. You can move these cards from one column to another as the status of the task changes.

3. **Automation**: GitHub Projects allows you to automate your workflow by setting up automatic actions. For example, you can set up a rule to automatically move an issue to the "In progress" column when someone starts working on it, and to the "Done" column when the issue is closed.

4. **Collaboration**: GitHub Projects is designed for collaboration. You can assign tasks to specific team members, and everyone on the team can see the status of all tasks on the project board.

In summary, GitHub Projects is a powerful tool for managing your work directly within GitHub. It provides a visual way to track the progress of tasks, automate your workflow, and collaborate with your team.

### Explain the layout options for projects

In GitHub Projects, you have several layout options to choose from to visualize and organize your work. These layout options determine how your project boards and columns are displayed.

1. **Basic Kanban**: This is the default layout option in GitHub Projects. It provides a simple Kanban-style board with columns representing different stages of work, such as "To Do," "In Progress," and "Done." You can create cards within each column to represent tasks, issues, or pull requests.

2. **Automated Kanban**: This layout option automatically creates and manages columns based on the labels applied to your issues or pull requests. For example, if you have labels like "Bug," "Feature," and "Enhancement," GitHub Projects will create corresponding columns for each label. As you apply or remove labels, the columns will be automatically updated.

3. **Automated Kanban with Review**: This layout option is similar to the Automated Kanban layout, but it includes an additional column for review. This column is useful when you have a separate review process for your work items.

4. **Repository**: This layout option allows you to view and manage your project boards within the context of a specific repository. It provides a repository-centric view of your project boards, making it easier to associate your work with a particular repository.

5. **Organization**: This layout option is available for organizations and provides a high-level view of all the project boards across multiple repositories within the organization. It allows you to track and manage projects at an organizational level.

To choose a layout option for your project, you can go to the project settings and select the desired layout. Keep in mind that the available layout options may vary depending on your GitHub plan and permissions.

Each layout option has its own advantages and is designed to cater to different project management needs. You can choose the layout that best suits your workflow and preferences to effectively manage and track your work in GitHub Projects.

### Describe the configuration options for projects

In GitHub, a project is a collection of issues, pull requests, and notes that are organized into columns of a project board. You can use projects to manage and track work within a repository. Here are some of the configuration options available for projects:

1. **Project Name and Description**: You can set a name and description for your project to clearly define its purpose and scope. This helps team members understand what the project is about.

2. **Project Board Layout**: GitHub provides several layout options for your project board, including Basic Kanban, Automated Kanban, Automated Kanban with Review, Repository, and Organization. You can choose the layout that best suits your workflow.

3. **Columns**: You can add, rename, or delete columns in your project board to represent different stages of your workflow. You can also configure automation settings for each column to automatically move cards based on certain triggers.

4. **Cards**: Cards represent tasks, issues, or pull requests in your project. You can add, edit, or delete cards within each column. You can also add labels, assignees, and milestones to cards to provide more context and detail.

5. **Access Permissions**: You can configure who can view and edit your project. You can make your project public (visible to anyone) or private (visible only to people you choose). You can also add collaborators to your project and assign them different roles and permissions.

6. **Notifications**: You can configure notifications for your project to stay updated on the project's progress. You can choose to receive notifications for all activity or only for specific events.

These configuration options allow you to customize your project to fit your team's needs and workflow, making project management more efficient and effective.

### Explain the difference between projects and projects classic

GitHub Projects and GitHub Projects Classic are both project management tools provided by GitHub, but they have different features and interfaces.

1. **GitHub Projects**: This is the newer version of GitHub's project management tool. It provides a more flexible and customizable interface for managing work. In GitHub Projects, you can create a project board and organize issues, pull requests, and notes into columns. You can also automate your workflow by setting up rules to automatically move items between columns based on certain triggers. GitHub Projects supports markdown in notes, allowing you to format text and create checklists. It also provides a timeline view for tracking the progress of your project.

2. **GitHub Projects Classic**: This is the older version of GitHub's project management tool. It provides a simpler and more straightforward interface for managing work. In GitHub Projects Classic, you can create a project board and organize issues and pull requests into columns, but it does not support notes or automation. It also does not support markdown in descriptions, and it does not provide a timeline view.

In summary, GitHub Projects provides more features and flexibility than GitHub Projects Classic, making it a more powerful tool for managing and tracking work. However, GitHub Projects Classic may be easier to use for simple projects due to its simpler interface.

### Explain the use of labels

Labels in GitHub are a versatile tool used to categorize and organize issues and pull requests. They are essentially tags that you can apply to issues or pull requests to provide additional context and information. Here are some of the main uses of labels:

1. **Categorization**: Labels can be used to categorize issues and pull requests based on their nature or type. For example, you can use labels like "bug", "feature", "enhancement", or "documentation" to indicate the type of work involved.

2. **Priority and Severity**: Labels can be used to indicate the priority or severity of an issue. For example, you can use labels like "high priority", "low priority", "critical", or "minor" to help prioritize your work.

3. **Status**: Labels can be used to track the status of issues and pull requests. For example, you can use labels like "in progress", "review needed", or "on hold" to indicate the current status of the work.

4. **Ownership**: Labels can be used to indicate who is responsible for an issue or pull request. For example, you can use labels to assign work to specific team members or departments.

5. **Versioning**: Labels can be used to indicate which version of the project an issue or pull request is related to.

6. **Workflow**: Labels can be used as part of your workflow to automate certain actions. For example, you can set up GitHub Actions to automatically move issues or pull requests to a specific column in your project board when a certain label is applied.

In summary, labels are a powerful tool in GitHub that can help you organize your work, communicate status and priority, and streamline your workflow. They are customizable, so you can create and use labels that best suit your project's needs.

### Explain the use of milestones

Milestones in GitHub are a tool used to group related work into specific time-bound goals. They are essentially a way to track the progress of a group of issues or pull requests towards a particular target or deadline. Here are some of the main uses of milestones:

1. **Goal Setting**: Milestones can be used to set specific goals or targets for your project. For example, you can create a milestone for each version or release of your project, and add all the issues or pull requests that need to be completed for that release to the milestone.

2. **Progress Tracking**: Milestones provide a way to track the progress of your work towards a specific goal. Each milestone has a progress bar that shows the percentage of completed and open issues or pull requests. This allows you to see at a glance how much work has been done and how much is left to do.

3. **Time Management**: Each milestone can have a due date, which helps with scheduling and time management. The due date provides a clear deadline for the work and helps ensure that the work is completed on time.

4. **Organization**: Milestones can help organize your work by grouping related issues and pull requests together. This can make it easier to manage and prioritize your work.

5. **Communication**: Milestones can help communicate the plan and status of your project to team members and stakeholders. By looking at the milestones, they can get a clear understanding of the project's goals, deadlines, and progress.

### Describe how to use and create template repos

A template repository is a special type of GitHub repository that is designed to be used as a foundation for new projects. It allows you to create a new repository with the same directory structure and files as the template repository. This can save you time and effort when starting a new project, especially if you often start projects with the same boilerplate code or documentation.

Here's how you can create and use template repositories:

**Creating a Template Repository**

1. First, create a new repository (or choose an existing one) that you want to make a template. This repository should contain the files and directory structure that you want to use as a starting point for new projects.

2. Go to the repository's settings page by clicking on the "Settings" tab.

3. Scroll down to the "Template repository" section and check the box that says "Template repository". This will mark the repository as a template.

4. Now, whenever you create a new repository, you will have the option to use this repository as a template.

**Using a Template Repository**

1. To create a new repository from a template, click on the "New" button on your GitHub homepage or go to the "Repositories" tab on your profile and click "New".

2. On the "Create a new repository" page, click on the "Repository template" dropdown. This will show a list of all the template repositories that you have access to.

3. Select the template repository that you want to use.

4. Fill in the rest of the details for your new repository (like the repository name, description, and visibility), and click "Create repository".

5. GitHub will create a new repository for you with the same files and directory structure as the template repository.

In summary, template repositories in GitHub provide a convenient way to start new projects with a predefined set of files and directories. They can help you maintain consistency across your projects and save time when setting up new projects.

### Explain how to create, edit, and delete saved replies

### Recognize how to add assignees to issues and pull requests

Assignees in GitHub are individuals who are responsible for working on an issue or pull request. Assigning individuals can help clarify who is responsible for what work, and it can help team members prioritize their tasks. Here's how you can add assignees:

**Adding Assignees to an Issue or Pull Request**

1. Navigate to the main page of the issue or pull request.

2. On the right side of the page, you'll see a section titled "Assignees". Click on the "assign yourself" link to assign the issue or pull request to yourself. Alternatively, click on the gear icon next to the "Assignees" section.

3. A dropdown menu will appear with a list of people who have access to the repository. You can select one or more people from this list to assign them to the issue or pull request. You can also start typing a username to filter the list.

4. After selecting the assignees, click outside the dropdown menu to close it. The selected assignees will now appear in the "Assignees" section.

In summary, adding assignees to issues and pull requests in GitHub is a straightforward process that can help organize and manage work within a project. It's a good practice to assign tasks to specific individuals to ensure responsibilities are clear and work is efficiently distributed.

### Explain how to use project workflows

Project workflows in GitHub are a way to automate your project management process. They are based on the concept of a Kanban board, where you have different columns representing different stages of your work (like "To do", "In progress", and "Done"), and you move items (issues or pull requests) between the columns as they progress through the stages.

Here's how you can use project workflows:

**Creating a Project Workflow**

1. Go to the main page of your repository and click on the "Projects" tab.

2. Click on the "New project" button. Fill in the name and description for your project, and choose a template for your project board. The "Automated Kanban" template is a good starting point for a project workflow.

3. Click on the "Create project" button. This will create a new project board with columns for "To do", "In progress", and "Done".

**Using a Project Workflow**

1. To add an issue or pull request to your project workflow, go to the issue or pull request page and click on the "Projects" link on the right side of the page. Select your project from the dropdown menu.

2. The issue or pull request will be added to the "To do" column of your project board. You can move it to the "In progress" column when you start working on it, and to the "Done" column when you finish it.

3. You can automate this process by setting up automation rules for your project board. For example, you can set up a rule to automatically move issues to the "In progress" column when someone is assigned to them, and to the "Done" column when they are closed.

In summary, project workflows in GitHub provide a visual way to track the progress of your work and automate your project management process. They can help you stay organized and manage your work more efficiently.

### Describe project insights

Project insights in GitHub provide a set of analytics and visualizations that help you understand the activity and performance of your project. They can give you a high-level overview of your project's health and progress, and help you identify areas where you might need to focus more attention. Here's a brief description of some of the main project insights:

1. **Pulse**: The Pulse section provides a summary of project activity over the past week or month. It shows the number of commits, pull requests, issues, and contributors during this period. It also highlights the most active pull requests and issues.

2. **Graphs**: The Graphs section includes several visualizations of your project data, such as commit activity, code frequency, and the punch card (which shows the days and times when commits occur). These graphs can help you understand the patterns and trends in your project activity.

3. **Network**: The Network graph shows the branch and fork history of your project. It can help you understand how your project has evolved over time and how different branches and forks relate to each other.
