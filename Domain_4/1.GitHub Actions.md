## GitHub Actions

### Describe GitHub Actions (basic understanding)

GitHub Actions is a feature of GitHub that allows you to automate, customize, and execute your software development workflows right in your repository. It makes it easy to automate all your software workflows, now with world-class CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment). You can build, test, and deploy your code right from GitHub.

Here's how GitHub Actions work:

1. **Workflows**: A workflow is a configurable automated process that you set up in your repository to build, test, package, release, or deploy any project on GitHub. Workflows are made up of one or more jobs and can be scheduled or triggered by an event.

2. **Events**: An event is a specific activity that triggers a workflow. This could be anything from pushing code, creating issues, or even scheduling the workflow to run at a specific time.

3. **Jobs**: A job is a set of steps that execute on the same runner. Jobs can run at the same time in parallel or be dependent on the status of a previous job and run sequentially.

4. **Steps**: A step is an individual task that can run commands in a job. A step can be either an action or a shell command.

5. **Actions**: An action is a standalone, reusable piece of code that can be used in jobs across different workflows.

In summary, GitHub Actions is a powerful tool that allows you to automate your software development workflows. It provides a way to create custom workflows composed of jobs, steps, and actions, which can be triggered by various events within your GitHub repository.

### Explain where you can use GitHub Actions within GitHub (general event types)

GitHub Actions can be used in any repository within GitHub. They are triggered by specific events that occur within your repository. Here are some general event types that can trigger a GitHub Action:

1. **Push and Pull Request Events**: These are the most common triggers. A push event occurs every time someone pushes commits to a repository. A pull request event occurs whenever a pull request is opened, closed, or synchronized.

2. **Issue Events**: You can trigger a workflow whenever an issue is created, edited, deleted, or closed.

3. **Release Events**: These events occur whenever a release is published, unpublished, created, edited, deleted, or a pre-release is released.

4. **Schedule Events**: You can also schedule workflows to run at specific times using POSIX cron syntax.

5. **Manual Events**: GitHub Actions can be manually triggered using the workflow_dispatch event.

6. **Repository Dispatch Events**: These are custom webhooks that you can use to trigger a workflow from an external event.

In summary, GitHub Actions can be used in any repository within GitHub and can be triggered by a wide variety of events, including push and pull request events, issue events, release events, schedule events, manual events, and repository dispatch events.

### Explain where you can find existing GitHub Actions

Existing GitHub Actions can be found in the GitHub Marketplace. The GitHub Marketplace is a central location for developers to browse, share, and use actions created by the community. You can find actions for a variety of tasks, such as deploying code, running tests, or automating issue responses.

To access the GitHub Marketplace, you can navigate to the main GitHub website and click on "Marketplace" in the top navigation bar. From there, you can select "Actions" in the left sidebar to browse available actions. You can search for specific actions, filter by categories, or sort by popularity or recent updates.

In addition to the GitHub Marketplace, you can also find actions in public repositories on GitHub. If an action is stored in a public repository, you can reference it in your workflows by using the owner/repository@ref format.

In summary, you can find existing GitHub Actions in the GitHub Marketplace and in public repositories on GitHub.
