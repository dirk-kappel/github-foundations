## Git and GitHub Basics
### Describe version control
A program that tracks changes to a collection of files.
- Goal 1: Easily recall earlier versions of individual files or of the entire project.
- Goal 2: Allow several team members to work on a project, even on the same files, at the same time without affecting each other's work.
- Software Configuration Management (SCM) system is another name for VCS.

### Define distributed version control
The project's complete history is stored both on the client and on the server.
- Files can be edited without a network connection, checked locally, and then synced with the server when a connection becomes available.

### Describe Git
A fast, versatile, highly scalable, free, open-source VCS that multiple developers and other contributors can use to work on a project.

### Describe GitHub
A cloud platform that uses Git as its core technology.
Features of GitHub:
- Issues
- Discussions
- Pull requests
- Notifications
- Labels
- Actions
- Forks
- Projects

### Explain the difference between Git and GitHub

### Describe a GitHub repository
The directory, located at the top level of a working tree, where Git keeps all the history and metadata for a project.

### Describe a commit
Making changes that were made available so that others can eventually see them.

### Describe branching
A series of linked commits that allow developers to work independently on and then later merge into the default branch.

### Define a remote in Git terminology
A named reference to another Git repository.
