## GitHub Markdown

### Identify the text formatting toolbar on issue and pull request comments

### Describe Markdown

Markdown is a markup language that offers a lean approach to content editing by shielding content creators from the overhead of HTML.

### Identify the basic formatting syntax

- __Headings__:  Use #-###### for a heading.
- __Links__: Use \[A Website\]\(/path/to/link\) to link to a website.
- __Task Lists__: \- [x] First task
- __Comments__: 
- etc:

### Explain where to find and use slash commands

Slash commands can save you time by reducing the typing required to create complex Markdown. ***Used in github Issues.***
**Command**|**Description**
-|-
/code|Inserts a Markdown code block. You choose the language.
/details|Inserts a collapsible detail area. You choose the title and content.
/saved-replies|Inserts a saved reply. You choose from the saved replies for your user account. If you add %cursor% to your saved reply, the slash command places the cursor in that location.
/table|Inserts a Markdown table. You choose the number of columns and rows.
/tasklist|Inserts a tasklist. This slash command only works in an issue description.
/template|Shows all of the templates in the repository. You choose the template to insert. This slash command works for issue templates and a pull request template.

#### Build tables

You can construct tables using a combination of pipes (|) for column breaks and dashes (-) to designate the prior row as a header.

1|2
3|4

#### Quote text

You can create blockquotes using the greater than (>) character.
> This is quoted text.

#### Fill the gaps with inline HTML

If you come across an HTML scenario not supported by Markdown, you can use that HTML inline.<br />
To create a break you can also end a line with two or more spaces.  
Here is a<br />line break
first line.<br>
second line.

#### Track task lists
