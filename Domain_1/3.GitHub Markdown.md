### Identify the text formatting toolbar on issue and pull request comments

When you're writing or editing a comment on an issue or pull request in GitHub, you'll see a toolbar at the top of the text box. This is the text formatting toolbar, and it provides shortcuts for adding Markdown formatting to your comment.

Here's a brief description of the options you'll find in the toolbar:

1. **Bold**: This button wraps the selected text in double asterisks (`**`), which makes the text bold in Markdown.

2. **Italic**: This button wraps the selected text in single asterisks (`*`) or underscores (`_`), which makes the text italic in Markdown.

3. **Hyperlink**: This button wraps the selected text in square brackets (`[]`) and follows it with empty parentheses (`()`), creating a placeholder for a link in Markdown.

4. **Code**: This button wraps the selected text in backticks (`` ` ``), which formats the text as inline code in Markdown.

5. **Quote**: This button adds a greater-than sign (`>`) before the selected text, which formats the text as a blockquote in Markdown.

6. **Bullet List**: This button adds an asterisk (`*`) before the selected text, which creates a bulleted list in Markdown.

7. **Numbered List**: This button adds a number followed by a period (`1.`) before the selected text, which creates a numbered list in Markdown.

8. **Task List**: This button adds a dash followed by space and square brackets (`- [ ]`) before the selected text, which creates a task list in Markdown.

9. **Mention**: This button adds an at sign (`@`) before the selected text, which creates a mention in Markdown.

10. **Emoji**: This button opens an emoji picker, allowing you to insert an emoji into your comment.

In summary, the text formatting toolbar in GitHub provides a convenient way to add Markdown formatting to your comments on issues and pull requests. It can help you create more structured and readable comments.

### Describe Markdown

Markdown is a markup language that offers a lean approach to content editing by shielding content creators from the overhead of HTML.

### Identify the basic formatting syntax

- __Headings__:  Use #-###### for a heading.
- __Links__: Use \[A Website\]\(/path/to/link\) to link to a website.
- __Task Lists__: \- [x] First task
- __Comments__: 
- etc:

### Explain where to find and use slash commands

Slash commands can save you time by reducing the typing required to create complex Markdown. ***Used in github Issues.***
**Command**|**Description**
-|-
/code|Inserts a Markdown code block. You choose the language.
/details|Inserts a collapsible detail area. You choose the title and content.
/saved-replies|Inserts a saved reply. You choose from the saved replies for your user account. If you add %cursor% to your saved reply, the slash command places the cursor in that location.
/table|Inserts a Markdown table. You choose the number of columns and rows.
/tasklist|Inserts a tasklist. This slash command only works in an issue description.
/template|Shows all of the templates in the repository. You choose the template to insert. This slash command works for issue templates and a pull request template.

#### Build tables

You can construct tables using a combination of pipes (|) for column breaks and dashes (-) to designate the prior row as a header.
First|Second
-|-
1|2
3|4

#### Quote text

You can create blockquotes using the greater than (>) character.
> This is quoted text.

#### Fill the gaps with inline HTML

If you come across an HTML scenario not supported by Markdown, you can use that HTML inline.<br />
To create a break you can also end a line with two or more spaces.  
Here is a<br />line break
first line.<br>
second line.

#### Track task lists

- [x] First task
- [x] Second task
- [ ] Third task
