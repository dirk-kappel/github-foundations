### Explain how to manage notifications through the GitHub Mobile app

The GitHub Mobile app provides a convenient way to stay updated with your GitHub notifications on the go. Here's how you can manage your notifications through the app:

1. **Accessing Notifications**: After you open the GitHub Mobile app and sign in to your account, you'll see a bell icon at the bottom of the screen. Tapping on this icon will take you to your notifications screen.

2. **Reading Notifications**: In the notifications screen, you'll see a list of all your unread notifications. These can include updates on issues, pull requests, and discussions that you're participating in or watching. Tapping on a notification will take you to the relevant issue, pull request, or discussion.

3. **Managing Notifications**: You can swipe left on a notification to reveal management options. These options include marking the notification as read, which will remove it from your unread notifications list, and saving the notification for later, which will move it to your "Saved" list.

4. **Filtering Notifications**: You can filter your notifications by repository or by notification reason (like "Assigned", "Mentioned", or "Subscribed"). To access these filters, tap on the "Filter" button at the top of the notifications screen.

5. **Configuring Notification Settings**: You can configure your notification settings by going to the "Settings" screen in the app. Here, you can choose whether to receive push notifications, and you can customize your notification preferences for each repository that you're watching.

In summary, the GitHub Mobile app provides a convenient way to manage your GitHub notifications from your mobile device. It allows you to read and manage your notifications, filter them based on your needs, and configure your notification settings.
